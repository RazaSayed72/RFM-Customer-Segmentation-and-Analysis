# RFM-Customer-Segmentation-and-Analysis
This project performs RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) on customer transactional data to evaluate customer value. Customers are scored based on RFM metrics and segmented into groups such as "Champions" or "At Risk" to drive tailored marketing strategies and improve retention.
